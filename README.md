## Aim and Hypothesis
For our investigation into the impact of flooding on seagrass, we aimed at exploring how tropical cyclones affect seagrass habitats and whether it will be exacerbated by anthropogenic activities. Following this research direction, we used the 2013 Queensland flood caused by the tropical cyclone Oswald as an example to explore the impact of the flooding on the seagrass community using the eReefs database. We also intended to explore how human activities and land modification may have exacerbated the impact of flooding events on seagrass habitat by comparing the data from the baseline and preindustrial models. As such, it was hypothesized that:
- **(i)** biomass and production of seagrass is strongly correlated with the environmental factors with or without anthropogenic impact (i.e. similar pattern will be observed in baseline and preindustrial models);
- **(ii)** discharge of Fine Sediment (FineSed) and Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) causes reduction in the seagrass biomass during flooding event and such reduction should be more severe in sites with high percentage of land modification and less severe as a whole as predicted in the preindustrial model than in baseline model; and
- **(iii)** recovery of seagrass biomass is faster in sites with less human impact and in the preindustrial model.

## Data
We have used the daily and monthly data from eReefs BioGeoChemical model extracted via the AIMS eReefs THREDDS portal.

Weather data were extracted from the Bureau of Meteorology

## Objectives and Analyses
- **Objective 1** - Understanding the general relationship between environmental and seagrass variables
- **Objective 2** - Visualizing the temporal change in seagrass biomass before and after flooding event under baseline and pre-industrial scenarios
- **Objective 3** - Testing the impact of tropical cyclone Oswald on seagrass during flooding event under different anthropogenic impact with statistical test
